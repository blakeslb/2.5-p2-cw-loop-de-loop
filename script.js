// Write a function that takes in a number and prints out each number till n (the number inputted). Stop the loop when the index is 5.


// Write some code that console.log's the message "Do I have to repeat myself?" 1000 times. Use a loop but make sure not to get stuck in an infinite loop!


// Write a function called countEven that takes a parameter n which is a whole number greater than or equal to 2.  When executed, countEven should console.log the even numbers from 2 to n.


// Imagine that each number in the numberArray below represents a person's age. Write a for...of loop that includes an if...else statement. If the element's value is under 18, print `The person is [#] years old. That is not old enough to vote.` to the console. If the element's value is 18 or more, print `This person can vote because they're [#] years old.` to the console. The [#] should be replaced by the value of the element in the array.

let numberArray = [0, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 33, 42, 55, 81, 89, 99];


// BONUS: Adjust the for...of loop in number 11 to say how many years it will be before the person can vote if they're under 18 and how many years they've been eligible to vote if they're over 18.
