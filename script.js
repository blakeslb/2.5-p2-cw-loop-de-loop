//1 Write a function that takes in a number and prints out each number till n (the number inputted). Stop the loop when the index is 5.


//2 Write some code that console.log's the message "Do I have to repeat myself?" 1000 times. Use a loop but make sure not to get stuck in an infinite loop!


/**
 * 3
 * A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the alphabet
 * Write a function that takes in a string parameter and returns true if the string is
 * a pangram, otherwise return false. Ignore case 
 */

// Uncomment to test: 
// console.log(isPangram('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'))
// console.log(isPangram('I am not a pangram'))
// console.log(isPangram('We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize'))
// console.log(isPangram('We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the prize'))



//4 Imagine that each number in the numberArray below represents a person's age. Write a for...of loop that includes an if...else statement. If the element's value is under 18, print `The person is [#] years old. That is not old enough to vote.` to the console. If the element's value is 18 or more, print `This person can vote because they're [#] years old.` to the console. The [#] should be replaced by the value of the element in the array.

let numberArray = [0, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 33, 42, 55, 81, 89, 99];


// BONUS: Adjust the for...of loop in number 11 to say how many years it will be before the person can vote if they're under 18 and how many years they've been eligible to vote if they're over 18.
